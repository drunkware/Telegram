## Telegram Ultra
This is my fork of Telegram with few changes from the main app that are not approved yet!:

* Disable trimming of spaces and newlines in messages to preserve the formatting.
* Simple markdown (Bold text, Color).
* Two options to forward messages (that includes text, video, photo, docs ....etc):
    - With original sender's name (like original app) "Quoted forwarding".
    - Without the original sender's name (will carry your name only) .
* Fix for many Whatsapp emoji which don't translate correctly to Telegram emoji.
* Increase of Emoji rendering size from 50 to 200.
* Increase message size from 2k to 4k.
* Show sender's name on videos, photos and documents.
* Share documents, photos and videos with other android apps.
